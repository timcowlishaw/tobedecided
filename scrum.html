<h1>What is Scrum?</h1>
<p>Scrum is a product development methodology that embodies the <a href="agile.html">Agile</a> principles, as well as incorporating
it's own <a href="pillars.html">Three pillars</a> of Transparency, Adaption and Inspection. Scrum recognises that customer requirements may
change, and therefore aims to ensure that the team is as responsive as possible to these changes in requirements.</p>

<p></p>A scrum team consists of a Product Owner, who is responsible for the Product vision, a Scrum Master, who is responsible for ensuring 
team follows the Scrum process, and the team - who are everyone else.</p>
