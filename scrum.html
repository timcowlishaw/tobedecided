  <h1>What is Scrum?</h1>
  <p>Scrum is a product development methodology that embodies the <a href="agile.html">Agile</a> principles, as well as incorporating
it's own <a href="pillars.html">Three pillars</a> of Transparency, Adaption and Inspection. Scrum recognises that customer requirements may
change, and therefore aims to ensure that the team is as responsive as possible to these changes in requirements.</p>

<h2> Scrum in IRFS </h2> 
<p>Scrum gives us a way to frequently check how we're getting on with a project. It allows us to spot problems quickly (at retrospective) and evaluate progress regularly (at the review). This should give us good visibility of how a project's getting on, and opportunities to decide whether to continue with particular pieces of work (or not).

<h2> Return on Investment </h2>

<p> The return on investment (ROI) for each user story is calculated from the value assigned to each user story divided by the difficulty on a fibonacci scale</p>


<h2> Roles </h2> 
<p>A scrum team consists of a Product Owner, who is responsible for the Product vision, a Scrum Master, who is responsible for ensuring 
team follows the Scrum process, and the team - who are everyone else.</p>
<h2> Definition of Done </h2>
<p>Set of criteria to be applied to each user story to help ensure quality. e.g. Code is peer reviewed  
</p>
<h2>Scrum events</h2>
<p>These are all time windowed</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sprint Planning</li>
  <li>Daily Standups</li>
  <li>Sprint Review</li>
  <li>Sprint Retrospectives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scrum Artifacts</h2>
 There are a number of <em>Artefacts</em> which can be useful for the SCRUM process, including:
 <ul>
     <li>
         The <em>Product backlog<em> which outlines the user stories remaining in the product. This is managed and prioritised by the Product Owner.
     </li>
     <li>The <em>Sprint backlog</em> which outlines the work the team has committed to deliver in a given sprint. This is decided on by the team in collaboration with the Product Owner<li>
         <li>The <em>Product and sprint burndown charts</em> which measure and track the progess in delivering the product and the increment to be worked on in a sprint<li>
