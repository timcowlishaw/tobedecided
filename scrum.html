<h1>What is Scrum?</h1>
<p>Scrum is a product development methodology that embodies the <a href="agile.html">Agile</a> principles, as well as incorporating
it's own <a href="pillars.html">Three pillars</a> of Transparency, Adaption and Inspection. Scrum recognises that customer requirements may
change, and therefore aims to ensure that the team is as responsive as possible to these changes in requirements.</p>

<h2> Scrum in IRFS </h2> 
<p>Scrum gives us a way to frequently check how we're getting on with a project. It allows us to spot problems quickly (at retrospective) and evaluate progress regularly (at the review). This should give us good visibility of how a project's getting on, and opportunities to decide whether to continue with particular pieces of work (or not).

<h2> Return on Investment </h2>
<p> The return on investment (ROI) for each user story is calculated from the value assigned to each user story devivded by the difficulty on a fibonacci scale</p>

<h2> Roles </h2> 
<p></p>A scrum team consists of a Product Owner, who is responsible for the Product vision, a Scrum Master, who is responsible for ensuring 
team follows the Scrum process, and the team - who are everyone else.</p>
