  <h1>Agile Manifesto</h1>
   
   <p></p>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Individuals and interactions:</b> self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming.</li>
     <li><b>Working software:</b> working software is more useful and welcome than just presenting documents to clients in meetings.</li>
     <li><b>Customer collaboration:</b> requirements cannot be fully collected at the beginning of the software development cycle, therefore continuous customer or stakeholder involvement is very important.</li>
    <li><b>Responding to change:</b> agile methods are focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.[12]</li>
   </ul>

   <p>That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
