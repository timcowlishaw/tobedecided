<h1>What is Agile?</h1>
<p><em>Agile</em> isn't a software development or project management methodology in itself, but an
    umbrella term for a set of principles and practices which reflect the values set out in the <a href="manifesto.html">Agile Manifesto</a>.
    In general, the idea of Agile software development is to work in an <em>iterative</em>, <em>collaborative</em> manner.</p>

<p>This has a number of advantages over more traditional ideas about how to build software: by reducing the time we spend on negotiation, planning and documentation,
    we can produce working software more quickly, be more responsive to changing circumstances, and work in a way that keeps us healthier and happier!</p>

<p>This site concentrates on a specific methodology called Scrum, which provides a concrete process for adopting and fostering agile values, based on the <a href="pillars.html">Three pillars</a> of scrum: <em>Transparency<em>, <em>Inspection</em> and <em>Adaptation</em>.</p>
